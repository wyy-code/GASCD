Paper for 2024

## Datasets

The dataset and the embedding we processed can be downloaded at [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wptKenCyYXvIfuNXjuE2dWmbHHkib3-5/view?usp=drive_link). You can also use the same datasets in [DATTI](https://github.com/MaoXinn/DATTI).

* ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
* ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
* rel_ids_1: ids for relations in source KG;
* rel_ids_2: ids for relations in target KG;
* sup_ent_ids: training entity pairs;
* ref_ent_ids: testing entity pairs;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;


## Just run main.py

## Environment

* Python == 3.7.0
* tensorflow == 2.6.0
* Numpy
